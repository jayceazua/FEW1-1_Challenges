<h1>Hypertext Markup Language</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p><dfn>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</dfn> is the standard markup language
    for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style
    Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone
    technologies for the World Wide Web.[4]</p>

  <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from
    local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
    HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and
    originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
